Pass two arguments and 1 is return value, Ask the input from the user (byte value and bit position).
Argument 1 can be byte value and argument 2 can be bit position in the byte value 
From that bit position can be left shifted with 1 and which can be stored in temperory variable as mask(fun has to flip to the bit position).
Then byte value xor with temperory variable mask that can store in binary value.
That stored byte value can be store in another variable as result.
That reslt value is the output.
