Set the bits TM0ON and PSA which are in 7th position(TM0ON) and 3rd position(PSA).
Take some hex value which is stored in a variable called n.
Store the positions in variables.
Then one is left shifted with 3(position) this can be ORed with one is again left shifted with 7(position).
That final result can be again ORed with n which is having hex value.
Then print n value as output.
