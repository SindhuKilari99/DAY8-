Take an array variable.
Sort the numbers using pointer with for loop and
If *(ptr+j) greater than *(ptr+i) then again start looping for small number.   
If *(ptr+j) less than *(ptr+i) then check the conditions which is about swapping logic using third variable.
After checking the statements of if condition then print the sorted elements in ascending order
